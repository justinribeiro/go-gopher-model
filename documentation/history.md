## How come the 3D Go Gopher was created?

The conversation went something like this:

> Walter (Developer): Go uses a Gopher as a mascot. We just want to highlight the language in a project.
>
> David (Animator): Here you go.
>
> Walter (Developer): Whoa that's trick. Why the sweet 3D animation?
>
> David (Animator): Because I can.

Which then results in animated jibbily jelly go gophers uniting on Vine:

Which then finally results in this repo of all the Go Gopher goodness. Enjoy!
