# Go Gopher Colors

It is not easy to find any official source stating the colors to be used for the Go Gopher mascot.

However, I found original the colors used for a vinyl Go Gopher toy in a presentation from the original creator of the mascot, [Renée French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_French).

The brand book for Go states a primary color named "Gopher blue".

A vectorized gopher in the brand book has yet another color.

To summarize, all the different colors originating from all kinds of "official" sources and the lack of explicit color definition gives a lot of freedom setting colors for your own gopher.

If you want a fair guess what the original color is supposed to be, you probably should take a look at the colors of the vinyl toy by as Renée French, the original designer, worked with the development of the toy and probably had a say in the colors used(?).

For other colors than blue for the mascot, perhaps a glance at the official Go colors from the brand book can be useful?

A set of colors used for the Go Gopher can be found in a presentation from Renée French, the original creator of the mascot. She presents the colors used for a Go Gopher vinyl toy. She did not seem to disapprove of the colors the manufacturers used as she showed them in the presentation.

## Go brand colors

The color of the Go Gopher is mentioned in the [brand guide for Go (v1.0 as of 2022-06-06)](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang-assets/Go-brand-book-v1.9.5.pdf) (section 2.1) as "Gopher blue". Mind though that it is probably just a name for their blue brand primary color as the brand guide states that the gopher is not part of the Go brand but an embraced ("beloved") mascot.
